# üì¶ Automated Box Reconciliation Dashboard ‚Äì Power BI Integration for SAP and Local Excel Systems

This repository hosts the Power BI visualization project designed to automate the reconciliation of box records between **SAP query data** and **locally formatted Excel-based tracking sheets**.  
The system provides real-time variance analysis, trend monitoring, and integrity reporting across multiple data sources.

## üéØ Project Overview

Traditional reconciliation between SAP and local operational records often involves manual checks that are time-consuming and error-prone.  
This Power BI solution bridges the two systems, **automating data comparison and variance tracking** through linked data models and Power Query transformations.

The **core objective** is to ensure data integrity by comparing:
- `BoxType_Clean` (from local Excel transformations)
- `BoxType_SAP_Clean` (from SAP query exports)
- Variances in the number of boxes and reconciliation status

## üß© Data Sources

| Source | Description | Format |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| **SAP Query Export** | Extracted transactional data from SAP Sales Orders | Excel (.xlsx) / CSV |
| **Formatted Excel Sheet** | Processed local file with Power Query transformations and calculated columns | Excel (.xlsx) |

The Power BI dashboard consumes both datasets and models them into unified relationships for live reconciliation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Power BI Components

### 1. **Power Query Editor**
- Handles all data transformations, merges, and column cleaning.
- Refreshes automatically when source data changes.

### 2. **Data Model**
- Establishes relationships between SAP and Local sources.
- Includes DAX measures for key indicators such as:
  - Total Boxes
  - Mismatch Count
  - Variance Percentage

### 3. **Visual Dashboard**
- Displays comparative insights using:
  - Variance Indicator Cards
  - Trend Line Charts
  - Box Type Distribution
  - Drop-off Point Comparison
  - Mismatch Heatmaps

## üìà Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| Metric | Formula | Purpose |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Total Records** | `COUNTROWS(Line_Compare)` | Number of records analyzed |
| **Mismatch Count** | `COUNTROWS(FILTER(Line_Compare, BoxType_Clean <> BoxType_SAP_Clean))` | Detects inconsistencies |
| **Variance %** | `DIVIDE([Mismatch Count], [Total Records], 0)` | Measures reconciliation accuracy |

---

## üßÆ Automation and Refresh Workflow

1. Data from both SAP and Excel sources are loaded into Power BI.
2. Power BI refreshes using:
   - **Power Query transformations** (for Excel formulas and cleaning)
   - **Scheduled refresh** (via Power BI Service or Power Automate)
3. The dashboard dynamically updates variance results after every refresh.

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **Microsoft Excel** | Data formatting, Power Query logic |
| **SAP Query Export** | Source transactional dataset |
| **Power BI Desktop / Service** | Visualization, DAX analytics, and automation |
| **GitHub** | Version control and project documentation |
